# EspoCRM for DevOps Examples

This repository will contain examples of how to use EspoCRM in DevOps environments, particularly with Docker. Some of the examples will be for Docker Compose, some for Ansible, and some for other tools.

If you're interested in this topic, please also consider starring this repository. It will help us gauge interest in this topic and prioritize our time.

## Current ideas for tutorials

- Migration from existing EspoCRM installation to Docker
- Migration to S3 and S3-compatible storage for file uploads (AWS, Minio, Cloudflare's R2, etc.)
- Using Ansible to deploy EspoCRM with Docker
- Backup and restore of EspoCRM with Docker using tools like Restic which supports S3 and S3-compatible storage, deduplication, and encryption

Ideas for examples are welcome. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/dubas-pro/espocrm-for-devops/issues/new) to discuss.
